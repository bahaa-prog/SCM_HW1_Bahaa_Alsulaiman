## Configuration Management Best Practices

Effective software configuration management ensures reliable and scalable systems. Best practices include maintaining version-controlled configuration files, automating deployments with tools like Ansible or Terraform, documenting all changes thoroughly, and testing configurations in isolated environments before applying them to production. These practices minimize risks, streamline updates, and preserve system integrity across development cycles.
