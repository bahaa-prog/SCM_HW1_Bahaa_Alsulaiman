Configuration management is vital for establishing a structured framework to manage system configurations, infrastructure, and dependencies. By maintaining a centralized and version-controlled repository of configurations, 
it ensures that changes or updates can be applied consistently and efficiently across environments. 
This minimizes risks, prevents unintended impacts on other system components, 
and supports scalability and maintainability in complex software ecosystems
